Computer science project - physics engine in c++.\

Progress of a University of Keele (UK) computer science degree final project looking into physics engines built in c++.\

Built on Linux Ubuntu v18.04 (latest patches), using gcc, open dynamics engine's drawstuff module (ODE physics engine not used,drawstuff is used for rendering).\

Version will also be built to utilise CUDA acceleration, on desktop computer with Intel i5-6500 CPU, 8Gb DDR4 RAM, nVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6Gb VRAM, on same versions of software as above. CUDA SDK (default that installs on machine).\

First version is a nearly complete version, so will not be from start of development of project.
